# Meme Me

## About the project
This app is about creating an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. 
The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.

MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and 
personal user experience.
